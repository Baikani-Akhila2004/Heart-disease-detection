# 🫀 Heart Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

This project presents a comprehensive research study on predicting heart disease using multiple supervised machine learning algorithms. It is based on a paper accepted/published for academic/IEEE/Google Scholar review.

## 📄 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality globally. Early diagnosis is critical in preventing fatal outcomes. This study utilizes a range of machine learning algorithms to analyze patient health parameters and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Among these, the **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the **highest accuracy of 95%**, outperforming other models on metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🧪 Dataset
- ✅ **Source**: Kaggle (Heart Disease Dataset)
- ✅ **Features used**: 
  - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting BP, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar
  - Max Heart Rate, Exercise-induced Angina, Old Peak, ST Slope
  - Resting ECG Results

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Google Colab
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Results & Evaluation
- Models were trained using 80% of the dataset and tested on 20%.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC Curve
- Random Forest showed best performance in terms of generalizability and robustness.
